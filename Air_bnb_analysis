Airbnb data analysis involves exploring and interpreting the large volumes of data collected from the platform to gain insights into user behavior, pricing trends, 
and market dynamics. 
The data typically includes information about listings (e.g., location, property type, number of bedrooms), host details, reviews, booking patterns, and prices.
Through this analysis, key questions can be answered, such as identifying the most popular locations, factors affecting property pricing, seasonal demand variations, 
and guest satisfaction levels. Techniques such as descriptive statistics, data visualization, and machine learning models are used to uncover trends, optimize pricing, 
improve customer experiences.
